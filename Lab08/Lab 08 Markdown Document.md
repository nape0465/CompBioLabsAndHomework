### Introduction 
In this lab I focused on writing a function to make a scatter plot for a logistic growth model.  I then made a function to make a matrix for the data in the logistic growth model. 

### Part 3a 
I created a new R Script for Lab 08 

### Part 3b and Part 3c
I turned the logistic growth model code (from week 4's lab) into a function with inputs: 
* r (for the intrinsic growth rate),
*  K (for the carrying capacity),
*  t (for number of generations) 
* n (for the initial population size) 

I made the function return a scatter plot of time on the x axis and abundance on the y axis. 

### Part 3d 
I tested the function that I made by plugging in 0.5 for the intrinsic growth rate, 1000 for the carrying capacity, 12 for the number of generations, and 100 for the initial population size.  The function did make a scatter plot. 

### Part 3e 
I then made a function to turn the logistic growth model code into a matrix (using the same inputs) which would be saved into my working directory (Lab08).
