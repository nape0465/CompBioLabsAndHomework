# Natalie's Independent Project on Schistosomiasis Data

## Introduction

This independent project will use the data from a study conducted in 2019 that explores how the presence of specific types of snail habitat can be used to predict the prevalence of schistosomiasis in nearby towns. My goal is to provide images that help me better understand the data and visualize trends present in the data.  I plan on doing this using the coding platform R- Studio.

## Summary of Data to be Analyzed


### Goals of original study that produced the data
The goal of the original study was to make it easier to find snails that serve as the intermediate host for the parasite schistosomiasis. In the past, sampling for snails in lakes and rivers could take an extremely long time. Therefore, this team of scientists used images taken from drones and satellites to find habitats that snails are drawn to and predict where the snails were located off of that. 

### Brief description of methodology that produced the data
To produce this dataset, the team of scientists used a number of descriptors to indicate snail habitat (for example "mud" to indicate the presence of mud at a testing site and "emerg" to indicate the presence of emergent vegetation at a testing site). They then looked at images from google earth for each testing site and recorded what aspects of snail habitat they found. They also visited the sites to see if there were any visual indicators of snail habitat. Finally, they sampled the testing site to see if there were in fact snails located there. 

### Type of data in this data set:  
Qualitative and Quantitative 
#### Format of data  
Excel Spreadsheet
#### Size of data (i.e., megabytes, lines, etc.)
There are 2797 rows of data and 70 columns of data. 

#### Any inconsistencies in the data files?  Anything that looks problematic?  
From what I've seen, this dataset actually looks pretty clean.  It looks like it would be fun to work with. 

#### What the data represent about the biology? 
This data represents the relationship between plants/ physical features of snail habitats and the actual presence of snails in these freshwater ecosystems.

## Detailed Description of Analysis to be Done and Challenges Involved

I would like to create visuals that explore which factors of snail habitat have the highest correlation with snail presence. Additionally, during this project, I would like to see if the schistosomiasis infections were related to the presence of the snail habitat features that the scientists were sampling.
