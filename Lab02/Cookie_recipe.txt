Cakey chocolate chip cookie recipe
2 1/4 cups of flour
3 eggs
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
3/4 cup of butter
1 cup of packed brown sugar
1 tsp vanilla
1 package of semi sweet chocolate chips

Kick the tires and light the fires to 375 degrees

Cream your butter and sugar together until they are light and fluffy. Add in the eggs, one at a time, beating in completely.Add the vanilla as well.

Whisk together your dry ingredients and add to the butter/sugar mixture. Combine well then add the chocolate chips, mixing until they are spread through the dough evenly.

Drop by well rounded tablespoons onto an ungreased or parchment lined sheet. Do not press them down if you want a lovely rounded top cakey cookie.

Bake at 375 for 8-10 minutes until golden brown. They will spread out slightly but still stay wonderfully puffy and cakey.
